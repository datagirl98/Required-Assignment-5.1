Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

Based on these observations, what do you hypothesize about drivers who accepted the bar coupons?
Findings/Conclusions

**1. They are socially active**
Drivers who go to bars more than once a month are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests they see real value in these offers and are already frequenting such venues.

**2. They are younger**
Drivers under age 30 had higher acceptance rates. This group may be more spontaneous, cost-conscious, and open to trying promotions or experiences.

**3. They are not widowed and likely more socially engaged**
Widowed drivers had lower acceptance rates. Drivers who are not widowed may be more likely to go out socially and thus find bar coupons more appealing.

**4. They do not usually drive with kids**
Drivers with non-kid passengers (friends, partners) accepted bar coupons more. This aligns with the assumption that they are going out for leisure, not family-oriented trips.

**5. They may be value-seeking or lower-income**
Those who frequent cheap restaurants and earn under $50K also had higher acceptance rates. This supports the idea that price-sensitive drivers are more likely to use discounts like bar coupons.
